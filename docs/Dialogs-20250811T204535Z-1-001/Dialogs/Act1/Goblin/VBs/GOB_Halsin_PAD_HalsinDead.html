<h4>Synopsis:</h4><span class='synopsis'>The party reacts to Halsin's death, commenting that they should investigate his corpse (prompting them to search his inventory/use Speak with Dead in order to find clues.)<br>NOTE: the party may or may not be the ones who killed Halsin. They may not even have been aware he was Halsin if he dies in the worg pen while in bear form (transforming back into an elf corpse).</span><hr>
