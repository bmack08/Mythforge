✅ **Phase 2**: Database & Infrastructure (Tasks 15-29) - SQLite models, type system, content blocks  
✅ **Phase 3**: AI Integration Layer (Tasks 30-50) - Complete multi-provider AI system with 8 specialized generators
✅ **Phase 5**: Sourcebook Generation Workflow (Tasks 69-88) - Project creation, budget engine, content pipeline
✅ **Phase 6**: Advanced Content Features (Tasks 89-107) - Encounter builder, NPC management, world building
✅ **Phase 7**: Balance & Validation Systems (Tasks 108-125) - Complete quality assurance and accessibility

### **Next Immediate Steps**
1. **Phase 9**: User Interface & Experience (Tasks 144-160) - Dashboard, AI assistant interface, mobile optimization
2. **Phase 10**: Collaboration & Sharing (Tasks 161-172) - Multi-user features, community features  
3. **Phase 11**: Advanced AI Features (Tasks 173-184) - Intelligent content adaptation, advanced generation
4. **Phase 4**: Homebrewery Integration (Tasks 51-68) - Editor embedding, content injection, rendering (Deferred)
5. **Phase 8**: Export & Publishing (Tasks 126-143) - Multi-format export, VTT integration, marketplace preparation (Deferred)

**🎯 CRITICAL INTEGRATION REQUIREMENT:**
All new features in Phases 9, 10, and 11 must integrate seamlessly with the Homebrewery editor running on `server.js` (port 3000). This editor is the core of Mythwright where DMs create, edit, and view their D&D content with the side-by-side markdown editor and D&D-styled renderer. All AI generation, collaboration features, and advanced UI must work within this existing editor environment.
