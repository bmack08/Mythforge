Structural Elements
Organization & Navigation
Clear Table of Contents: Each sourcebook opens with a list of parts or chapters. Chapters are grouped logically (e.g., character creation, equipment, adventuring, combat, spells). Hyperlinks allow navigation.
Heading Hierarchy: Headings use a numbered or hierarchical system (e.g., Part 1 – Creating a Character, Chapter 3 – Playing the Game). Sections within chapters use bold or italic subheadings.
Call‑out Boxes & Sidebars: Many books include boxed text. The Basic Rules introduction uses dialogue excerpts between a DM and players; those passages are indented and set apart from the main text[1]. Adventures often use boxed narration for the DM to read aloud. Sidebars are used to explain rules, list examples or tables, or provide designer notes.
Cross‑References: Text frequently references other chapters or appendices. For example, the Wildemount guide notes that its gazetteer appears in chapter 3[2]. Monsters in the Monstrous Compendium refer readers to the Monster Manual introduction for a primer on stat blocks[3].
Tables & Lists: Lists are used for summarizing features, such as creature summaries[4]. Rules often employ numbered lists (e.g., the three steps of the game cycle[5]).
Appendices: Books conclude with appendices for conditions, deities, factions, planes of existence, or extra monsters[6].
Narrative Tone
Inviting and Descriptive: The Basic Rules introduce D&D as “about storytelling in worlds of swords and sorcery”[7]. They liken the game to childhood make‑believe but note that D&D adds structure with dice rolls[8].
Use of Second Person: When instructing players or DMs, the text speaks directly (“You’ll find new subclasses…”)[9]. This makes instructions feel personal and encourages engagement.
Third‑Person World‑Building: Setting guides use a descriptive, almost literary style. Explorer’s Guide to Wildemount opens with a raven observing battlefields and cities before stating that the raven “sees Wildemount”[10]. It describes landscapes and cultures in evocative terms (e.g., “menagerie coast,” “golden sand,” “lush jungle,” “boundless sapphire sea”[11]).
Emphasis on Flexibility: Text stresses that anything is possible in D&D. The Basic Rules highlight that there’s no winning or losing and campaigns can last for years[12].
Encouraging Tone for New Players: Wildemount’s introduction tells readers that the setting is for players and DMs of all experience levels[13] and offers quick summaries for major regions[14].
Rule Presentation
Plain‑Language Explanations: Rules are explained clearly and concisely. For example, the Basic Rules describe the three activity categories (exploration, interaction, combat)[15] and outline the basic game cycle in three numbered steps[5].
Examples & Dialogue: The Basic Rules illustrate gameplay with a short dialogue between a DM and players investigating Castle Ravenloft[16]. Examples often include dice rolls and decisions, helping readers understand mechanics.
Stat Blocks: Monster entries use standardized stat blocks with ability scores, armor class, hit points, speed, and special abilities. The entry for an asteroid spider includes a short lore paragraph followed by mechanical details and action descriptions[17]. Abilities are bolded and described succinctly (e.g., False Appearance gives advantage on initiative rolls[18]).
World‑Building & Setting Design
Macro to Micro: Setting books start with broad themes before drilling into specific regions. Wildemount’s chapter on nations briefly introduces each nation and suggests campaign themes such as political intrigue or wilderness survival[19].
Atmospheric Hooks: Descriptions use sensory details and metaphors. In the Wildemount introduction, the raven imagery conveys themes of life, death and mystery[10]. Similarly, the Monstrous Compendium describes creatures such as asteroid spiders with vivid imagery (“body 30 feet in diameter … resembles a giant, lifeless rock in space”[20]).
Player & DM Guidance: Setting books address both audiences. For the DM, they suggest how to run campaigns in a region or incorporate new monsters and items[9]. For players, they introduce new subclasses, backgrounds or magic items[21].
Adventures & Modules
Although full access to adventure texts (e.g., Curse of Strahd or The Wild Beyond the Witchlight) is restricted via the text‑only browser, these modules share common stylistic traits evident in free intros:

Boxed Narrative Text: Scenes that the DM reads aloud are presented in boxed or indented text. They employ present‑tense descriptive prose to immerse the players.
Scene‑by‑Scene Structure: Adventures are organized by chapters or locations. Each area includes a summary, boxed text, notable characters, treasures, and encounter descriptions.
Encouraging Improvisation: Sidebars encourage DMs to adjust encounters. Warnings remind DMs to adapt difficulty and reward creativity.
Flavorful Side Content: Appendices contain new character options, monsters, magic items, or handouts.
Recommendations for a Custom Sourcebook Generator
Based on the style analysis, a generator that creates D&D‑like sourcebooks should incorporate the following design principles:

Structured Layout: Organize content into parts, chapters and clear sections. Begin with an introduction or preface that sets the tone and explains the scope of the book. Provide a hyperlinked table of contents for navigation.
Descriptive Hooks: Open chapters with evocative prose—use metaphors and sensory detail to paint the setting (e.g., a raven’s flight over Wildemount[10]). Include italicized or boxed stories to immerse readers.
Second‑Person Guidance: When instructing players or DMs, address them directly (“You can…” or “As a DM, you’ll find…”). This invites engagement and clarifies who the instruction is for[9].
Rule Clarity: Present rules in plain language with short paragraphs. Use numbered lists for procedural steps (e.g., the basic gameplay cycle[5]) and bullet lists for options or summaries.
Examples & Dialogue: Include example play sequences or short dialogues to illustrate how rules work in practice[16]. Box these examples to distinguish them from core rules.
Cross‑Referencing: Provide links or references to related sections. For instance, when introducing monsters, remind the reader to review the stat‑block guide[22].
Stat Blocks & Tables: For mechanical elements (monsters, spells, equipment), use standardized stat‑block tables. Include ability scores, AC, HP, speed, actions, traits, and challenge rating. Summarize lists of creatures or items in tables with columns for name, CR/level and a brief description[4].
Appendices & Extras: Conclude with appendices for conditions, magic items, factions, deities, or other supplementary material[6]. Provide ready‑to‑use NPCs or monsters.
Tone & Flexibility: Emphasize that the material is a toolkit. Encourage customization, highlight that there are no strict win conditions, and reassure readers that they can adapt the content to their campaign[12].
Inclusive Writing: Address both new and experienced players, offering guidance at different levels of detail. Include sidebars with suggestions for adjusting difficulty or tailoring content to different play styles.
Conclusion
The free content on D&D Beyond—particularly the Basic Rules and Monstrous Compendium—provides a clear template for writing Dungeons & Dragons source material. The style balances evocative narrative with clear, structured rules and encourages imagination while providing enough guidance to play confidently. A custom sourcebook generator should replicate this blend of immersive description, instructional second‑person guidance, standardized stat blocks and helpful cross‑references to produce content that feels authentic to 5th‑edition D&D.
